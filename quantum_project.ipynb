        "* negatively charged (-)\n",
        "\n",
        "We can define certain boolean rules that should be true for a CDR3 sequence that would bind to a specific peptide. E.g, it should start and end with a hydrophobic amino acid and there should be at least 2 polar ones and so on. Then we want to search for possible candidate solution with grover's search algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "These rules should be used for our oracle that decides if a CDR3 sequence is a \"correct\" solution or not. If the rules can be written down in boolean logic it's easier to use them for the oracle than most other approaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "It turns out that we can have sequences of physical properties of length 5 with this approach, e.g. ['P', '+', 'P', 'H', '-']\n",
        "\n",
        "As candidate solutions, we could get a result like this.\n",

        "### Motivation and Biological Context\n",
        "T cell receptors (TCRs) play a central role in adaptive immunity by recognizing short peptide fragments presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. In cancer immunotherapy, a key goal is to identify or design TCRs that specifically recognize tumor-associated peptides while avoiding off-target binding to healthy tissue. Successful identification of such TCRs can enable downstream therapeutic strategies such as TCR-engineered T cell therapy, where patient T cells are genetically modified to express a tumor-reactive receptor and then reinfused.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most variable and specificity-determining part of the TCR is the CDR3 (Complementarity-Determining Region 3) loop. Its amino-acid composition and physicochemical properties largely determine peptide binding. However, the combinatorial diversity of possible CDR3 sequences is enormous, making exhaustive enumeration or brute-force design infeasible even classically, let alone biologically.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project explores whether quantum search techniques, specifically Grover’s algorithm, can be used as a conceptual framework to search for candidate CDR3 patterns that satisfy biologically motivated constraints relative to a given cancer peptide.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Abstracting the Biological Problem\n",
        "Rather than working directly at the amino-acid level, we introduce a coarse-grained encoding of CDR3 sequences. Each CDR3 position is represented not by a specific amino acid, but by one of four physicochemical classes:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `H` — hydrophobic  \n",
        "- `P` — polar  \n",
        "- `+` — positively charged  \n",
        "- `−` — negatively charged  \n",
        "\n",
        "Each class is encoded using 2 qubits, allowing a compact quantum representation. For example, a 5-position CDR3 core is represented using 10 data qubits. This abstraction captures biologically relevant properties (hydrophobic anchoring, electrostatic complementarity, flexibility) while keeping the search space small enough to fit on near-term quantum hardware.\n",
        "\n",
        "Importantly, the project does not assume a predefined list of candidate sequences. Instead, it defines a rule-based search space: a CDR3 candidate is considered valid if it satisfies a set of interpretable biological rules derived from immunological heuristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Rule-Based Search Space\n",
        "The rules encode simplified but biologically motivated constraints, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "- hydrophobic residues at the ends of the CDR3 loop (anchoring and structural stability)\n",
        "- a polar residue in the center (flexibility and specificity)\n",
        "- electrostatic complementarity between the cancer peptide core and the CDR3 contact region\n",
        "- avoidance of overly charged motifs that could lead to nonspecific binding\n",
        "\n",
        "Crucially, these rules define a **predicate**, not a list. We do not enumerate valid CDR3 sequences in advance; instead, a candidate is accepted or rejected algorithmically. This distinction matters because Grover’s algorithm assumes access to an oracle that can verify a candidate, not construct solutions directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Oracle Formulation\n",
        "To apply Grover’s algorithm, the biological rules must be translated into a Boolean predicate\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "f(x) \\in \\{0,1\\},\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $x$ is a binary encoding of a CDR3 pattern. The oracle marks exactly those quantum basis states corresponding to candidates that satisfy all rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, the oracle is implemented as a phase oracle:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "|x\\rangle \\rightarrow (-1)^{f(x)} |x\\rangle.\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key design constraints**\n",
        "- the oracle must be diagonal in the computational basis\n",
        "- the predicate must be implemented reversibly\n",
        "- no classical precomputation or enumeration of all valid solutions is allowed\n",
        "- the total qubit count is restricted to 12 qubits, reflecting realistic near-term hardware limits\n",
        "\n",
        "To enable nontrivial logical combinations of rules (AND conditions, parity constraints, peptide-dependent logic), the circuit uses:\n",
        "- **10 data qubits** (CDR3 encoding)\n",
        "- **1 work ancilla** (clean $|0\\rangle$, used for intermediate computation)\n",
        "- **1 phase ancilla** prepared in $|-\\rangle$ for phase kickback\n",
        "\n",
        "This structure allows the oracle to compute biologically meaningful predicates while remaining a valid Grover oracle.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Quantum Search and Interpretation\n",
        "Grover’s algorithm is then used to amplify the amplitudes of all CDR3 patterns that satisfy the biological rules. Depending on how restrictive the rules are, the algorithm can be tuned to amplify:\n",
        "\n",
        "- a single candidate (design-like setting), or\n",
        "- a small set of candidates (screening-like setting)\n",
        "\n",
        "The output of the quantum circuit is not a final therapeutic sequence, but a set of coarse-grained CDR3 patterns enriched for biologically plausible peptide binders. These patterns could then be refined classically into concrete amino-acid sequences and evaluated using structural modeling, machine learning predictors, or experimental assays.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Resulting Therapeutic Use Case\n",
        "In a realistic pipeline, this approach would serve as an early-stage candidate generation or filtering step:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Start with a known cancer-associated peptide.\n",
        "2. Use a quantum-assisted rule-based search to identify plausible CDR3 patterns.\n",
        "3. Expand these patterns into specific amino-acid sequences.\n",
        "4. Evaluate binding and specificity using classical computational methods.\n",
        "5. Select top candidates for experimental validation and TCR engineering.\n",
        "\n",
        "While current quantum hardware limits this approach to small, abstracted problems, the project demonstrates how biological reasoning can be translated into quantum oracles, and how quantum search can be meaningfully integrated into immunotherapy-related design tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conceptual Takeaway\n",
        "This project does not claim a quantum advantage in practice today. Instead, it demonstrates:\n",
        "\n",
        "- how biological constraints can be encoded as Boolean predicates\n",
        "- why Grover’s algorithm naturally fits verification-based biological searches\n",
        "- why rule-based formulations are essential when explicit enumeration is infeasible\n",
        "- how quantum computing concepts can be aligned with realistic biomedical questions\n",
        "\n",
        "In that sense, the work serves both as a technical exploration of oracle design and as a conceptual bridge between quantum algorithms and computational immunology.\n"
